# Schedule Health Check Macro - Results Interpretation Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to interpret the results from the 14-Point Schedule Health Check macro for MS Project, including identification of potential false positives and recommended actions.

## Scoring System
- **95-100%**: PASS - Meets best practice standards
- **80-94%**: MARGINAL - Minor issues that should be addressed
- **Below 80%**: FAIL - Significant issues requiring immediate attention

## Individual Check Interpretations

### 1. Logic Check - Missing Dependencies (Critical)
**What it checks**: Tasks without predecessors or successors

**Good Score (>95%)**: Most tasks are properly linked in a logical network

**Poor Score (<80%)**: Many tasks are "floating" without relationships

**Potential False Positives**:
- Project start/finish milestones legitimately have no predecessors/successors
- Level of Effort (LOE) tasks may not need logic
- Administrative tasks (e.g., "Project Management") may be duration-based

**How to Verify**: 
- Filter for tasks with no predecessors/successors
- Exclude legitimate exceptions (LOE, admin tasks)
- Verify remaining tasks truly need logic

### 2. No Negative Lag Time (Critical)
**What it checks**: Use of leads (negative lag) in relationships

**Good Score (100%)**: No negative lags used

**Poor Score (<100%)**: Negative lags present

**Potential False Positives**:
- Fast-tracking activities where overlap is intentional and well-managed
- Design-build scenarios with controlled overlap

**How to Verify**:
- Review each negative lag individually
- Document business justification for any retained negative lags
- Consider replacing with explicit tasks showing the overlap

### 3. No Excessive Lags (Important)
**What it checks**: Lags greater than 20 working days

**Good Score (100%)**: All lags are 20 days or less

**Poor Score (<95%)**: Multiple relationships with excessive lag

**Potential False Positives**:
- Procurement lead times that are genuinely long
- Curing/drying times in construction
- Regulatory review periods

**How to Verify**:
- Review each lag >20 days
- Verify if lag represents actual waiting time
- Consider creating explicit "waiting" tasks instead

### 4. Minimal Hard Constraints (Critical)
**What it checks**: Use of date constraints other than ASAP/ALAP

**Good Score (>95%)**: Schedule is primarily logic-driven

**Poor Score (<80%)**: Many hard constraints limiting schedule flexibility

**Potential False Positives**:
- External milestones (contract dates, regulatory deadlines)
- Resource availability windows
- Weather windows or seasonal constraints

**How to Verify**:
- Review Constraint Type and Constraint Date columns
- Document business reason for each constraint
- Try removing constraint to see impact on schedule

### 5. Total Float Reasonableness (Important)
**What it checks**: Tasks with float between -5 and 44 days

**Good Score (>90%)**: Float values are within reasonable range

**Poor Score (<80%)**: Many tasks with extreme float values

**Potential False Positives**:
- Early project phases naturally have more float
- Non-critical paths in well-structured schedules can have high float
- Negative float may indicate legitimate schedule pressure

**How to Verify**:
- Sort tasks by Total Slack
- Review tasks with float >44 days for missing logic
- Check negative float tasks for driving constraints

### 6. Critical Path Integrity (Critical)
**What it checks**: Critical path comprises 10-30% of tasks

**Good Score (100%)**: Critical path is reasonable length

**Poor Score (<100%)**: Too few or too many critical tasks

**Potential False Positives**:
- Simple projects may legitimately have >30% critical tasks
- Complex projects with multiple paths may have <10% critical
- Resource-leveled schedules may show different critical percentages

**How to Verify**:
- Display critical path
- Verify it runs from project start to finish
- Check for broken logic creating multiple critical paths

### 7. Task Duration Reasonableness (Important)
**What it checks**: Task durations between 1-44 days

**Good Score (>95%)**: Most tasks have reasonable durations

**Poor Score (<90%)**: Many tasks exceed 44-day guideline

**Potential False Positives**:
- LOE tasks (project management, QA support)
- Procurement/fabrication activities
- Commissioning or testing phases
- Summary tasks incorrectly included

**How to Verify**:
- Filter for tasks >44 days duration
- Verify each represents a single scope element
- Consider breaking down long tasks

### 8. Resource Assignment Check (Moderate)
**What it checks**: Work tasks have resource assignments

**Good Score (>80%)**: Most work is resource-loaded

**Poor Score (<60%)**: Schedule lacks resource assignments

**Potential False Positives**:
- Planning packages not yet detailed
- Customer-provided activities
- Subcontracted work tracked differently
- Organizations that don't resource-load schedules

**How to Verify**:
- Check organizational standards for resource loading
- Filter for work tasks without resources
- Verify if resources are tracked elsewhere

### 9. Baseline Date Variance (Important)
**What it checks**: Current dates within 10 days of baseline

**Good Score (>80%)**: Schedule tracking close to baseline

**Poor Score (<60%)**: Significant variance from baseline

**Potential False Positives**:
- Approved change orders not re-baselined
- Early project stages with approved acceleration
- Projects without formal baselines yet

**How to Verify**:
- Check if baseline is current and approved
- Review change log for approved changes
- Compare variance to project stage

### 10. No Excessive Float (Moderate)
**What it checks**: Tasks with more than 44 days float

**Good Score (>95%)**: Few tasks have excessive float

**Poor Score (<90%)**: Many high-float tasks

**Potential False Positives**:
- Parallel paths with legitimate float
- Optional or "nice-to-have" scope
- Tasks constrained by external dependencies

**How to Verify**:
- Review high-float task logic
- Verify these aren't hiding critical work
- Check for missing finish-to-start links

### 11. No Logic on Summary Tasks (Important)
**What it checks**: Summary tasks should not have logic links

**Good Score (100%)**: Summary tasks used only for organization

**Poor Score (<100%)**: Summary tasks have predecessors/successors

**Potential False Positives**:
- Hammock activities that look like summaries
- Milestones at summary level
- Interface points between subprojects

**How to Verify**:
- Review each summary with logic
- Verify it's truly a summary, not a work package
- Move logic to appropriate detail tasks

### 12. Milestone Duration = 0 (Critical)
**What it checks**: All milestones have zero duration

**Good Score (100%)**: Milestones properly defined

**Poor Score (<100%)**: Milestones with duration

**Potential False Positives**:
- None - milestones should always be zero duration

**How to Verify**:
- Filter for Milestone = Yes
- Check Duration column
- Convert any with duration to tasks

### 13. Adequate Schedule Margin (Important)
**What it checks**: Buffer between project finish and deadline

**Good Score (>90%)**: Adequate margin exists

**Poor Score (<60%)**: Insufficient schedule margin

**Potential False Positives**:
- Projects without defined external deadlines
- Agile/iterative projects with different margin concepts
- Margin held in management reserve, not schedule

**How to Verify**:
- Confirm deadline/constraint date is accurate
- Check if margin exists but isn't visible in schedule
- Review risk register for margin requirements

### 14. Status Date Currency (Moderate)
**What it checks**: Status date within 7 days of today

**Good Score (100%)**: Recently updated

**Poor Score (<80%)**: Status date is old

**Potential False Positives**:
- Monthly update cycles may show as "old"
- Projects in planning phase without status updates
- Completed projects

**How to Verify**:
- Check project phase and update cycle
- Verify if updates are tracked differently
- Confirm project is active

## Overall Score Interpretation

### EXCELLENT (95-100%)
- Schedule follows best practices
- Minor tweaks may still be beneficial
- Good candidate for baselining

### GOOD (80-94%)
- Generally well-constructed schedule
- Address FAIL items first
- Review MARGINAL items for improvement

### FAIR (60-79%)
- Schedule has significant issues
- Prioritize CRITICAL check failures
- May need major restructuring

### POOR (Below 60%)
- Schedule requires major rework
- Focus on logic and constraint issues first
- Consider rebuilding problem sections

## Best Practices for Using Results

1. **Run regularly**: Execute monthly or after major updates
2. **Track trends**: Monitor score changes over time
3. **Document exceptions**: Keep a log of justified exceptions
4. **Prioritize fixes**: Address CRITICAL fails first
5. **Validate findings**: Always verify before making changes

## Common False Positive Patterns

1. **Early Planning Stages**: Incomplete schedules may score poorly but are appropriate for the project phase
2. **Specialized Industries**: Construction, R&D, or regulatory projects may have legitimate exceptions
3. **Organizational Standards**: Some organizations don't follow all DCMA guidelines
4. **Tool Limitations**: MS Project constraints may force certain approaches

## Customization Recommendations

- Adjust thresholds based on your industry
- Add checks for organization-specific requirements
- Exclude certain task types from specific checks
- Create different rule sets for different project phases

Remember: This tool provides guidelines, not absolute rules. Professional judgment should always be applied when interpreting results and implementing changes.
