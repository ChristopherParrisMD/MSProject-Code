The **DCMA 14-Point Schedule Assessment** evaluates the technical integrity of a project schedule using the following checks:

1. **Logic:** At least 95% of tasks should have valid predecessor and successor relationships.
2. **Leads:** No more than 5% of relationships should have leads (negative lag).
3. **Lags:** No more than 5% of relationships should use lag.
4. **Relationship Types:** Finish-to-Start (FS) should be used in at least 90% of relationships.
5. **Hard Constraints:** No more than 5% of tasks should have hard constraints (e.g., Must Start On).
6. **High Float:** No more than 5% of incomplete tasks should have total float greater than 44 working days.
7. **Negative Float:** No tasks should have negative total float.
8. **High Duration:** No more than 5% of tasks should have durations greater than 44 working days.
9. **Invalid Dates:** No tasks should have actual start or finish dates in the future.
10. **Resources:** At least 95% of tasks should be resource-loaded (if required).
11. **Missed Tasks:** Tasks that should have started or finished based on status date but have not.
12. **Critical Path Test:** The schedule should have a valid and continuous critical path.
13. **Critical Path Length Index (CPLI):** Should be ≥ 0.95.
14. **Baseline Execution Index (BEI):** Should be ≥ 0.95.

These metrics help assess schedule realism, logic integrity, and readiness for Earned Value Management (EVM) reporting.

**DCMA 14-Point Schedule Health Check: Definitions and Implications**

1. **Logic**

   * **Definition:** Validates that at least 95% of tasks have logical predecessors and successors.
   * **Implication:** Tasks lacking logic links cannot support network calculations or critical path analysis, undermining schedule credibility.

2. **Leads**

   * **Definition:** Measures use of negative lag (lead time) between tasks, which should be under 5%.
   * **Implication:** Excessive leads may signal unrealistic acceleration or poor schedule discipline, obscuring true dependencies.

3. **Lags**

   * **Definition:** Evaluates use of lag time in relationships; should not exceed 5% of total links.
   * **Implication:** Overuse can mask schedule risks and complicate impact analysis.

4. **Relationship Types**

   * **Definition:** At least 90% of relationships should be Finish-to-Start (FS), the preferred logic type.
   * **Implication:** Excessive use of other types (e.g., SS, FF) may indicate complex or non-standard sequencing, reducing interpretability.

5. **Hard Constraints**

   * **Definition:** Tracks use of constraints like "Must Start On" or "Must Finish On"; should be <5%.
   * **Implication:** Overuse restricts schedule flexibility and may create artificial float or negative float conditions.

6. **High Float**

   * **Definition:** Flags tasks with total float >44 working days.
   * **Implication:** Suggests poor network logic or disconnected tasks, which do not contribute to schedule integrity.

7. **Negative Float**

   * **Definition:** Identifies tasks with total float <0, indicating late completion relative to constraints or milestones.
   * **Implication:** Signifies the project is behind schedule and that corrective action is needed to avoid milestone violations.

8. **High Duration**

   * **Definition:** Highlights tasks with durations exceeding 44 working days.
   * **Implication:** Long durations reduce control and tracking fidelity; such tasks should be decomposed for better management.

9. **Invalid Dates**

   * **Definition:** Detects actual start or finish dates occurring after the project’s status date.
   * **Implication:** Indicates improper status updates or data entry errors, undermining forecast reliability.

10. **Resources**

    * **Definition:** Checks whether tasks are resource-loaded (≥95% if required).
    * **Implication:** Absence of resource data limits visibility into workload, capacity, and cost planning.

11. **Missed Tasks**

    * **Definition:** Counts tasks that should have started or finished before the status date but are not marked as complete.
    * **Implication:** Indicates performance lag, affecting Earned Value and execution credibility.

12. **Critical Path Test**

    * **Definition:** Ensures the schedule contains a continuous and logical critical path.
    * **Implication:** A broken or fragmented critical path suggests the schedule is unreliable for forecasting project completion.

13. **Critical Path Length Index (CPLI)**

    * **Definition:** Compares the remaining duration on the critical path to total float; should be ≥0.95.
    * **Implication:** Low CPLI indicates the schedule lacks sufficient margin and may be at risk of delay.

14. **Baseline Execution Index (BEI)**

    * **Definition:** Measures the ratio of actual completed tasks to those planned through the status date; target is ≥0.95.
    * **Implication:** Low BEI indicates delays in execution, requiring analysis and potential re-planning.
